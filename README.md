The sentiment analysis done by the "compute_user_emotions.py" script requires downloading the emotion dictionary found here: http://pythonism.wordpress.com/2013/06/16/elementary-sentiment-analysis-on-a-text-using-python/ and placing it in the same directory.

The webapp requires Flask ( http://flask.pocoo.org/ ) and Flask OAuth ( http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-OAuth/ ), which can be installed via pip or easy_install.
